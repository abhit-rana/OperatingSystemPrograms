Command to compile all files together:
make

Command to run the file(it is main file which would lead to the execution of logic for Q1):
./main

Processes S1, SR and ST are created with the help of the fork() command inside the main process and the pid of the process S1 is stored in some variable in the main process.

functions inside the processes:

S1:
a signal handler for the signal:SIGTERM is registered with the help of the sigaction() and also setting the sa_flags to SA_SIGINFO to retrieve the data sent along the signals. Inside the signal handler the data sent along the signal is fetched from the siginfo_t structure member: sigval si_value, and depending on the type of data it is printed with the help of the printf().

SR:
inside this process the program E1 is loaded with the help of the execvp() and the pid os the process S1 is passed as the argument to the program
    Inside the program E1:
    the signal SIGALRM is repeteadly generated with the help of the setitimer() which uses the two main arguments: one is for the way in which counter must decrease for this question it is set to ITIMR_REAL and the second important argument is the structure of type sigaction in which we set the time period of interval and the repeatition time of the interval; for the question we set the time period of interval and the repetition time of interval as 1 seconds. signal handler for the SIGALRM is implemented in which we generate the rnadom number by calling the function rdrand32_step(uint32_t *rand) in which we uses rdtsc instruction which set the 30 bit's of the ECX register and set value in the memory space pointed by the rand pointer and then we use the sigqueue() which uses three arguments: one as pid of the process to which signal is to be sent , other a argument is the signal to be sent to the process(which is the SIGTERM for the this question) and last is the union sigval in which we set the random number generated into the sival_int member.

ST:
inside this process the program E2 is loaded with the help of the of execvp() and the pid of the process is passed as argument to the program:
    Inside the program E2:
    similarly to the E1 program the signal SIGALRM is generated repeatedly with the help of the setitimer() with the same time period of interval and interval repetition time. signal handler for the SIGALRM is implemented in which we generate the the number of the clock cycles since the last reset with the help of the rdtsc instruction by calling the function implemented in the inline assembly which copies the clock cycles in the TSC register into the EAX:EDX. now the clock cycles we get are converted into the number of seconds(by dviding clock cycles by 60), minutes(diving no of seconds by 60) and the hours(diving the no of miutes by 60) and this geneted time stamp is converted into the string which is combined to string representing the current date which is generated by the help of struct tm which is equated to the localtime(&now), now is the time_t variable and this local time is breaked into days, months, and years and then converted into the string. this string generated is similalry to the program E1, enqueued along with the signal sent and then passed with the sigqueue() whose third argument:sigval structure's member sival_ptr is set to the string generated of the current date and time and also the signal enqueued with the sigqueue() is SIGTERM.
